The following is a summary list of data sources for am.  For complete
references, see Paine, S. 2024, SMA Technical Memo No. 152 rev. 14.0
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.640645).


Spectral line data are derived from the HITRAN2020 database and other
sources noted below.  The principal reference for HITRAN2020 is

 I.E. Gordon et al. 2022, "The HITRAN2020 molecular spectroscopic
  database."  Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative
  Transfer 277:107949 (See also http://www.hitran.org/)

Partition functions for most species are from the TIPS_2021 database:

 R. R. Gamache, et al. 2021, "Total Internal Partition Sums for the
  HITRAN2020 database.", Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and
  Radiative Transfer 271:107713.

Water vapor line data are from the aer_v_3.8.1 database, copyright
(c) Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. (AER), 2020, and
archived at https://zenodo.org/record/512012.  For further information,
see http://rtweb.aer.com.

N2O line data from HITRAN2020 are augmented with data from the JPL
spectral line catalog.  See:

 H.M. Pickett et al. 1998, "Submillimeter, millimeter and microwave
  spectral line catalog."  Journal of Quantitiative Spectroscopy and
  Radiative Transfer 60:883.  (See also http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov)

16O2 line mixing data are derived from

 D. S. Makarov, M. Yu. Tretyakov, and P. W Rosenkranz 2011, "60-GHz
  oxygen band: Precise experimental profiles and extended absorption
  modeling in a wide temperature range."  JQSRT 112:1420.

In addition, 16O2 line data from

 M. Yu. Tretyakov, M. A. Koshelev, V. V. Dorovskikh, D. S. Makarov,
  and P. W. Rosenkranz 2005, "60-GHz oxygen band: precise broadening
  and central frequencies of fine-structure lines, absolute absorption
  profile at atmospheric pressure, and revision of mixing coefficients."
  J. Mol. Spec. 231:1.

have been merged into the HITRAN line data.  Nonresonant O2 absorption
lines from the HITRAN catalog have been replaced with a single effective
16O2 line; the air broadening parameter for this line is from

 H. J. Liebe 1985, "An updated model for millimeter wave propagation in
  moist air."  Radio Science 20:1069.

The strength of the nonresonant O2 absorption was adjusted to fit the
microwave data in Table 2 of

 L. Danese and R. B. Partridge 1989, "Atmospheric emission models:
  confrontation between observational data and predictions in the
  2.5-300 GHz frequency range."  Ap. J. 342:604.

The millimeter-wave coupled+nonresonant O2 absorption was adjusted to
fit the laboratory measurements in

 A. I. Meshkov and F. C. DeLucia 2007, "Laboratory measurements of dry
  air atmospheric absorption with a millimeter wave cavity ringdown
  spectrometer."  JQSRT 108:256.

by applying a slight bias to the first-order mixing coefficients in
Makarov et al., referenced above.  See the source file o2.c for
details.

Finally, the broadening coefficients of several O2 lines have been
adjusted to follow the aer_v_3.8.1 database referred to above.  See the
source file o2.c for details.


Water vapor continuum absorption data are from the MT_CKD (v4.2) model,
maintained by the Radiative Transfer Working Group at Atmospheric and
Environmental Research, Inc. (AER). See http://rtweb.aer.com.  MT_CKD
is archived at https://github.com/AER-RC/MT_CKD.  See:

 E.J. Mlawer, V.H. Payne, J.-L. Moncet, J.S. Delamere, M.J. Alvarado, and

Collision-induced absorption

have been modified in am - see the source code for details.)

For N2-N2, am has been validated from 93 K to 343 K with the experimental
data in:

For O2-O2, am has been validated at 300 K only, using the data of

  compressed gases in the far infrared, Part II." Can. J. Phys. 43:751
