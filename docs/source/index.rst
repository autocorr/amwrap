Documentation
=============
Welcome to the documentation for ``amwrap``, a Python wrapper for Scott
Paine's atmospheric radiative transfer code AM.  For details on AM see the
official Zenodo links to the `source`_ and `documentation`_. Further
information can be found on Scott Paine's `website`_.  This package provides a
simple interface for configuring vertical profiles of atmospheric physical
properties and then predicting observed quantities such as transmittance,
delay, sky brightness temperature, and opacity.

See the :doc:`Installation <installation>` for installation instructions.
The source code may be found on `GitHub`_.
